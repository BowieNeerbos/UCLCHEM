# version 3.0 prerelease 3

## Python First
We now assume users will use the python version of UCLCHEM. It's possible but difficult to make the original binary. 

However, you can now use pip to install UCLCHEM. You need to `pip install .` from the top directory of the UCLCHEM repository each time you run MakeRates in order to update your network but after that, you can `import uclchem` in your python scripts from anywhere.

UCLCHEM no longer uses STOP statements and instead return errors on failures. This should let python users handle them gracefully.

## Docs overhaul
- New tutorials with more in depth examples of how to use the python module.
- Utility scripts for contributors to autogenerate docs.

## Physics improvements
- Optionally attenuate cosmic rays with column density following [Padovani et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09348)
- Users no longer need to recompile to run different physical models

## Solver
- Subroutines that solve ODEs have improved handling of failed integrations and should no longer be able to endlessly stall


## Bug fixes
- Fixed bug that meant non-thermal desorption methods ignored maximum boundary constraints
