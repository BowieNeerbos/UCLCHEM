# Electron Abundance
- v2 introduced a bug where electron abundance would be set to zero at start of every run. We've fixed that.
- Best abstol/reltol values for stability have been selected from a grid search

#Stability improvements
Running UCLCHEM with nothing initially on the grains using physical parameters that give very high desorption rates used to cause integration failures, code is now much more robust to this.
