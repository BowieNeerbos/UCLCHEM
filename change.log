# Eley Rideal
Eley-Rideal reactions between a grain surface and gas phase species are now handled by UCLCHEM and makerates. They must be listed with three reactants: [gasphase species, grain species, "ER"]

# Chemical Desorption
All Langmuir-Hinshelwood (formerly DIFF and CHEMDES) reactions and all Eley-Rideal reactions are now duplicated by MakeRates to account for the chemical desorption fraction. Each reaction should now only be listed once in the input eg:
```
H,#H,ER,#H2,,,,1,0,0,,,
#H,#H,LH,#H2,,,,1,0,0,,,
```

#H2 Formation
H2 formation via the ER and LH mechanisms have been added and together, approximate the observed H2 formation rate of sqrt(T)*1e-17. However, the Cazaux and Tielens 2004 rate has also been included. This is controlled by a switch in chemistry.f90
```    LOGICAL :: PARAMETERIZE_H2FORM=.True.```


#MakeRates improvements
Ongoing work to improve MakeRates and make it a python 3.8 script with slimmed down code.
