Rate Efficiency Upgrade
Makerates now outputs one array for each type of reaction UCLCHEM can work with.
All reactions are sorted by reaction type so each array contains first and last index corresponding to a reaction type.

rates.f90 updated to drop massive reaction list loop and just use indices to calculate whole rates array sections at once.

No decrease in run time but the code is more readable.
