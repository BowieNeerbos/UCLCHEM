Unversioned 3.0 prerelease

#CR attenuation
Optionally attenuate cosmic rays with column density following [Padovani et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09348)

# Physics Modules
We've update the code so that physics modules are all compiled together and are accessed through different functions. As a result, users no longer need to recompile to move from modelling hot cores to cshocks.


#Pip!
You can now use pip to install UCLCHEM. You need to `pip install .` from the top directory of the UCLCHEM repository each time you run MakeRates in order to update your network but after that, you can `import uclchem` from anywhere.
